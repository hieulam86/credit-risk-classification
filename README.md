# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to develop and assess the performance of a machine learning model for predicting credit risk. The dataset used contains information on loans, including features such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, and debt-to-income ratio. The goal is to create a model that accurately classifies loans as either healthy (0) or high-risk (1) based on these features.

## Results

- **Accuracy Score:** 99%
- **Precision Score (Label 0):** 100%
- **Precision Score (Label 1):** 86%
- **Recall Score (Label 0):** 100%
- **Recall Score (Label 1):** 91%

## Summary

The machine learning model demonstrates exceptional performance in predicting credit risk. With an accuracy of 99%, the model successfully identifies both healthy and high-risk loans. Notable precision and recall scores indicate the model's ability to minimize false positives and capture a significant portion of high-risk loans.

**Recommendation:**
Based on the high precision, recall, and overall accuracy, I recommend deploying this logistic regression model for credit risk assessment. The model excels in identifying high-risk loans while maintaining high precision for healthy loans. This balanced performance is crucial for minimizing financial risks for the company.

**Justification:**
The decision to recommend this model is supported by its exceptional performance metrics. The high precision and recall values, along with an accuracy rate of 99%, provide confidence in the model's ability to make accurate credit risk predictions. It aligns with the company's objective of minimizing the risk of default while ensuring the approval of healthy loans.

If the consequences of false positives or false negatives are significant, it's advisable to conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine the model's suitability in the specific business context. Regular monitoring and updates to the model may also be necessary to adapt to changing trends in credit risk.
